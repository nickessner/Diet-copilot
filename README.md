## Shopping and recipe assistant

### The intention of this work is to unify and automate a system to support healthy eating by way of reducing the mental load required to prepare a grocery list and search for recipes meeting specific dietary goal criteria. The fdcAPI pulls data from the Food Data Central - the USDA's food data repository. This includes nutritional information for a vast array of foods, collected from controlled lab sampling. The spoonacularAPI notebook accesses spoonacular's library of recipes.

### This work is in the exploratory phase. More advancements are required to more fully understand how to package this. Could this be a weekly PDF? Could this be a more interactive website? Could this be an assistant used at a grocery store built using an LLM? More exploration and development are necessary to better understand a pathway to adoption and monetization.
